# RedPitaya
Collection of references for my Red Pitaya research project funded by the University of Kentucky.

# Purpose
This GitHub repository is a publically available set of documents created during my undergraduate research at the University of Kentucky. My research is centered around the application of the Red Pitaya ecosystem of open-source FPGAs and their application to independent research, academics, and the professional space. Throughout my documentation I rely on Red Pitaya's GitHub at https://github.com/RedPitaya/RedPitaya.git.
